sleeping gnome mcmulty
gregor mcmulty was a fine man, if not a wee bit short... and with a tendency for narcolepsy. his knack for sleeping in people's yards earned him the nickname "sleeping gnome." garden gnome-hood is not how one would typically choose to be remembered, but you take immortality however it comes.

gap at the edge of the world
this masterpiece by the artist christopho has been heralded as the pinnacle of the "urbanomorphic abstractionism" movement. the artist describes the piece as "deconstructing the crisis of a man living in the modern world through a representation of the space between a subway platform and the rails."

finding peace
this captivating work has caused endless debate in art circles for decades. most of the controversy surrounds the title of the work: “finding peace.” some suggest that peace is the name of the young woman in the portrait. others believe that she came to this place in the woods to begin a quest for personal peace, where still others argue that the painting clearly shows the moment that the woman achieves peace. who was this young dreamer, and what will bring her peace?
